## Exploratory Data Analysis Project Workflows

The goal of this project was to EDA (Exploration Data Analysis) approach to figure this data out and discover valuable information. The used car dataset is downloaded from the popular website ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/turkibintalib/saudi-arabia-used-cars-dataset)) and I used various charts to get many paramount insights. In addition, I handled missing data by using four different techniques.
This repository contanins the following:
1. the dataset of the project are two version: "UsedCarsSA_Clean_EN.csv" is for the EDA, and "UsedCarsSA_Clean_EN06.csv" is for missing data imputation.
2. The proposal of this project [Project_Proposal_Khalid_Alqahtani.pdf](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/Project_Proposal_Khalid_Alqahtani.pdf "Project_Proposal_Khalid_Alqahtani.pdf").
3. MVP (Minimum Viable Product): it is the initial work of the project and it can be seen the progress of the project. it is in the repo as [MVP.ipynb](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/MVP.ipynb "MVP.ipynb") and the code [MVP_Code.ipynb](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/MVP_Code.ipynb "MVP_Code.ipynb")
4. The report of the project [Report.pdf](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/Report.pdf "Report.pdf")
5. The code of the project [The Project_Code.ipynb](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/The%20Project_Code.ipynb "The Project_Code.ipynb")
6. The presentation of the project [The_Project_Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/khalid8060/T0bootcampProject/blob/main/The_Project_Presentation.pptx "The_Project_Presentation.pptx")
